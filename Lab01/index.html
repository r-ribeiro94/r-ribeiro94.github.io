		        	<h1> Marshmallow </h1>
		            <p> Android Marshmallow had an official release date of August 17, 2015. The first device that ran Marshmallow was the Nexus family, which includes Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player. It's very similar to it's predecessor, Lollipop, but their are some minor changes that google has done to improve the OS. You can find out all the differences by clicking the android mascot. </p>

		        	<h1> The All Mighty Model S </h1>
		            <p> Tesla's Model S is the closest car that we can call a 'driveless car'. Although, it does have the autopilot feature, which will park, change lanes and drive for you it also has limitations. Take the driving automatically, well it will only do so up to 90 miles (or 144 km) after that the driver must take control of the care. In the case of changing lanes, it will only change one lane at a time, so you must click it everytime you switch. Lastly, the auto park will only work with a curb. Even with these limitations this piece of technology is marvelous, it's a step-forward into the future. </p>

		            <h1> The Budget Phone on Steroids </h1>
		            <figure><img src="images/zen_laser.png"></figure>
		            <p> When talking about ASUS, their will always be conversation about their Motherboards, or sleek laptops, but the topic of Smartphones rarely comes up. Well, in 2015 ASUS had started launching budget phones, that felt pretty close to a flagship phone. This seems to be the trend with most new phone companies, which is great because it will create competition with high rollers like Apple and Samsung, thus giving us cheaper and better product. The ASUS Zenfone 2 family is definetly a bang for your buck. Their are multiple variations from the Max which has a 5000mAh battery to the regular Zenfone 2 sporting a 2.3GHZ Quad Core Intel processor with 4GB of ram all for the price of 400$ CAD (300$ USD). Hopefully, this becomes the trend in the future, that way you don't have to worry about when you break your phone and have to lash out $800+ on a new phone. </p>

					<h1> The Surface Book </h1>
					<figure><img src="images/surface_book.png"></figure>
					<p> The Surface Book is equivalent to the Surface Pro devices except that it is marketed as a laptop with a fully detachable keyboard. It is Microsoft's first ever laptop. On paper it is a very high end device with a sleek look, so it doesn't feel like you're chuging a brick around. </p>

		        	<h1>Goal Line Technology</h1>
		            <p> Goal Line Technology primarily used in soccer, is a technology where it detects if the ball has crossed the assigned line to be considered a goal. It was implemented to stop the controversy between the refree and the players. It was first introduced nationaly in the World Cup 2014, where it actually helped the referee make the correct call. Althoug it is invotative technology their is still skeptism about the use of it and how it can slow down the game. </p>

			    	<h1> Rasberry Pie </h1>
			    	<p> The Rasberry Pi has been a fundamental piece of technology to help students learn to code. The price tag for one of the Pi's is around $10 to $40, now considering the price of a computer before was quite expensive and big. This machine will allow teachers to introduce programming to many more students as we live in the age of the computers, it is definitely a fundamental skill to learn. It is essentially a mini computer that just runs the basics, to allow the user to program. </p>
